## Tracing My Steps in Tech - #1 Motivation

### TL;DR: "The past is a prologue." — _William Shakespeare (from The Tempest)_. Maybe. Maybe not. But revisiting my journey might offer some useful insights into what lies ahead.

Although I never imagined studying computer science, I ended up majoring in it at university, despite having only a vague idea of what it entailed at the time of admission. Thanks to the guidance of many insightful seniors during my university years, I am now working in one of the hottest fields: AI, pushing the boundaries of innovation as a researcher. Whether by intention or luck, the choices I've made over the past ten years have brought me to a place I’m truly grateful for.

Now that my personal life is more settled than ever, I often ponder what lies ahead. Among various thoughts, I frequently find myself contemplating the future of the IT field, in which I am deeply involved. Despite spending considerable time thinking about what the next big thing might be, each session ends with different and inconclusive answers, prompting me to reflect on my journey. Thankfully, I’ve consistently been a few years ahead, studying the next big thing just before it became mainstream. Revisiting my path as a software engineer and researcher might provide some insights into the future of IT.

Additionally, I want to consider the mindsets I’ve held at different stages of my career. Recently, I've come to appreciate that mindset and motivation are crucial in everything I do. With a long road still ahead, I want to ensure I use my time in the most meaningful way possible. By the end of this series, I hope to have a concrete answer to the big question: where is IT heading?
