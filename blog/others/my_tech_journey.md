## Tracing My Steps in Tech - #1 Where Is Technology Heading Next?

### TL;DR: "The past is a prologue." — _William Shakespeare (from The Tempest)_. Maybe. Maybe not. But revisiting my journey might offer some useful insights into what lies ahead.

Although I never imagined studying computer science, I ended up majoring in it at university, despite having only a vague idea of what it entailed at the time of admission. Thanks to the guidance of many insightful seniors during my university years, I am now working in one of the hottest fields: AI, pushing the boundaries of innovation as a researcher. Whether by intention or luck, the choices I've made over the past ten years have brought me to a place I’m truly grateful for.

Now that my personal life is more settled than ever, I often ponder what lies ahead. Among various thoughts, I frequently find myself contemplating the future of the IT field, in which I am deeply involved. Despite spending considerable time thinking about what the next big thing might be, each session ends with different and inconclusive answers, prompting me to reflect on my journey. Thankfully, I’ve consistently been a few years ahead, studying the next big thing just before it became mainstream. Revisiting my path as a software engineer and researcher might provide some insights into the future of IT.

Additionally, I want to consider the mindsets I’ve held at different stages of my career. Recently, I've come to appreciate that mindset and motivation are crucial in everything I do. With a long road still ahead, I want to ensure I use my time in the most meaningful way possible. By the end of this series, I hope to have a concrete answer to the big question: where is IT heading?

## Tracing My Steps in Tech - #2 How I Began My Career with Web Development

### TL;DR: In general, web development has the largest market and the lowest barrier to entry, which is why most developers start their careers in this field.

It was indeed a coincidence how I ended up selecting computer science as my major (there’s a story behind it, but I'll save it for another time). When I first enrolled, my understanding of computer science was quite limited. However, I quickly discovered that the problem-solving and logical thinking involved in programming was something I not only enjoyed but also had a natural aptitude for.

The first industry-focused skills I developed were in web development. As a student at the University of Waterloo, I was required to complete multiple internships before graduating. When I entered the internship market for the first time, I quickly realized that my competitors weren’t just other students with similar expertise and knowledge, my real contenders were seniors with more experience. Recognizing this, I understood that securing an internship had to be my top priority, rather than holding out for the perfect opportunity. To increase my chances, I decided to aim for a high-demand field: web development. Many developers begin their careers in front-end development because it typically requires less knowledge of the system's overall infrastructure.

My first internship was at a startup called Mozzaz Corp., where I learned the basics of web development with a focus on front-end. I had a great time at Mozzaz, but I vividly remember the challenges our team faced when working with designers. They often requested changes that seemed simple, like relocating a component, but were quite difficult to implement. This experience made me realize that I preferred working on projects where the stakeholders are other developers--people who are already familiar with the engineering effort involved.

## Tracing My Steps in Tech - #3 My Journey into Big Data and Deep Learning

### TL;DR: Despite the emphasis on deep learning, I argue that we are still predominantly in the era of Big Data.

The next two years went smoothly and were filled with enjoyable experiences. I made unforgettable memories with colleagues while immersing myself in fascinating new knowledge. I built a solid foundation in computer science through my courses and gained valuable hands-on experience through multiple internships. As my perspective on software engineering broadened, I began to recognize emerging trends and the overall direction of technological advancements. One trend that particularly caught my attention was Big Data.

In 2016, I enrolled in a course titled "Big Data Infrastructure." The first lecture, which covered the origins of Big Data, was not only insightful but also memorable, especially since it was when I first met Jimmy Lin, who later supervised me throughout my master’s program. I still recall most of the content from that lecture, as I have repeatedly shared it with my colleagues since then.

Big Data emerged from the success of social networks (SNS). In the early 2010s, platforms like Twitter and Facebook harnessed the true potential of the internet, establishing global user bases and generating an immense amount of data. At that time, computational power was insufficient to process all this data effectively, so companies opted to store it first and address its utilization later. Over the years, advancements in hardware enabled these companies to process the data more efficiently and extract meaningful insights. This shift sparked increased interest and efforts in developing infrastructure capable of handling large volumes of data and deriving valuable information to benefit businesses, effectively closing the loop.

As time went on, I learned about the development of deep learning, which is closely connected to the Big Data story. The concept of neural networks and their mathematical foundations have been explored since the 1980s. However, achieving practical results was difficult due to limited computational power and inadequate data. Much like the evolution of Big Data, these ideas were revisited and realized as advancements in technology progressed and more data became available.

Understanding the origins of these trends clarified the future trajectory of technology. The tools I explored in the Big Data course, such as Spark and Hadoop, were particularly eye-opening, as their fundamental operations differed significantly from traditional sequential processes. I also enjoyed seeing how Big Data could transform vast amounts of seemingly meaningless data into valuable insights.

In my final year of university, I focused on deepening my expertise in this area. I gained hands-on experience with various large-scale data processing tools, including Spark and Hadoop, as well as deep learning frameworks like Keras and TensorFlow. I particularly enjoyed my project at Uber, which involved integrating TensorFlow with Spark to enable advanced data analysis through deep learning within a Spark-based infrastructure.

I firmly believe that we are still very much in the era of Big Data. Although AI, particularly deep learning, is a prominent theme today, its advancements would not be possible without the foundational progress made in Big Data. I am truly grateful for the many insightful individuals I encountered during my undergraduate years. Their guidance played a crucial role in shaping my journey and helping me achieve the successes that I am proud of today.
