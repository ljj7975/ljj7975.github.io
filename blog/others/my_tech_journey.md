## Tracing My Steps in Tech - #1 Motivation

### TL;DR: "The past is a prologue." — _William Shakespeare (from The Tempest)_. Maybe. Maybe not. But revisiting my journey might offer some useful insights into what lies ahead.

Although I never imagined studying computer science, I ended up majoring in it at university, despite having only a vague idea of what it entailed at the time of admission. Thanks to the guidance of many insightful seniors during my university years, I am now working in one of the hottest fields: AI, pushing the boundaries of innovation as a researcher. Whether by intention or luck, the choices I've made over the past ten years have brought me to a place I’m truly grateful for.

Now that my personal life is more settled than ever, I often ponder what lies ahead. Among various thoughts, I frequently find myself contemplating the future of the IT field, in which I am deeply involved. Despite spending considerable time thinking about what the next big thing might be, each session ends with different and inconclusive answers, prompting me to reflect on my journey. Thankfully, I’ve consistently been a few years ahead, studying the next big thing just before it became mainstream. Revisiting my path as a software engineer and researcher might provide some insights into the future of IT.

Additionally, I want to consider the mindsets I’ve held at different stages of my career. Recently, I've come to appreciate that mindset and motivation are crucial in everything I do. With a long road still ahead, I want to ensure I use my time in the most meaningful way possible. By the end of this series, I hope to have a concrete answer to the big question: where is IT heading?

## Tracing My Steps in Tech - #2 How I Began My Career with Web Development

### TL;DR: In general, web development has the largest market and the lowest barrier to entry, which is why most developers start their careers in this field.

It was indeed a coincidence how I ended up selecting computer science as my major (there’s a story behind it, but I'll save it for another time). When I first enrolled, my understanding of computer science was quite limited. However, I quickly discovered that the problem-solving and logical thinking involved in programming was something I not only enjoyed but also had a natural aptitude for.

The first industry-focused skills I developed were in web development. As a student at the University of Waterloo, I was required to complete multiple internships before graduating. When I entered the internship market for the first time, I quickly realized that my competitors weren’t just other students with similar expertise and knowledge, my real contenders were seniors with more experience. Recognizing this, I understood that securing an internship had to be my top priority, rather than holding out for the perfect opportunity. To increase my chances, I decided to aim for a high-demand field: web development. Many developers begin their careers in front-end development because it typically requires less knowledge of the system's overall infrastructure.

My first internship was at a startup called Mozzaz Corp., where I learned the basics of web development with a focus on front-end. I had a great time at Mozzaz, but I vividly remember the challenges our team faced when working with designers. They often requested changes that seemed simple, like relocating a component, but were quite difficult to implement. This experience made me realize that I preferred working on projects where the stakeholders are other developers--people who are already familiar with the engineering effort involved.
